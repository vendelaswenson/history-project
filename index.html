            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The French Revolution was a period of radical political and social upheaval in France from 1789 to 1799. It marked a major turning point in French history and had a significant impact on the world.</p>
            <p>The revolution was sparked by a combination of economic, social, and political factors. France was facing financial crisis due to years of war and extravagant spending by the monarchy. The rigid social structure, with privileges and inequalities, caused widespread discontent among the common people.</p>
            <p>The revolution began with the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority, on July 14, 1789. This event marked the start of the revolution and the people's demand for liberty, equality, and fraternity.</p>
            <p>The revolutionaries aimed to overthrow the absolute monarchy and establish a constitutional monarchy. They adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which proclaimed the principles of individual rights, freedom of speech, and equality before the law.</p>
            <p>During the revolution, the monarchy was abolished, and King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette were executed. France went through a period of radical changes, including the Reign of Terror led by Maximilien Robespierre, where thousands were executed under the revolutionary tribunal.</p>
            <p>The revolution also saw the rise of political factions, such as the Jacobins and Girondins, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who eventually became the First Consul and later the Emperor of France.</p>
            <p>The French Revolution had a profound impact on the world. It spread the ideas of liberty, equality, and nationalism across Europe and inspired revolutionary movements in other countries. It also led to important political and social reforms in France, including the establishment of a secular state, legal reforms, and the end of feudalism.</p>
